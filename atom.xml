    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><font size = "6"> <strong>Zian Wang</strong> </font><br>School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh<br><font size = "4"> <strong>Contact</strong> </font>  : <a href="mailto:&#122;&#x69;&#x77;&#52;&#x32;&#x40;&#x70;&#105;&#116;&#116;&#46;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;">&#122;&#x69;&#x77;&#52;&#x32;&#x40;&#x70;&#105;&#116;&#116;&#46;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;</a><br></br></p><h2 id="About-Me"><a href="#About-Me" class="headerlink" title="About Me"></a>About Me</h2><p>I am a graduate student studying at the University of Pittsburgh, School of Computing and Information. My major is Infomation Science. I will graduate in December 2022 and am applying for Ph.D. programs. I received two Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Computing and Information Science during my undergraduate period.</p><p>I am currently doing research about NLP in the <a href="https://picsolab.github.io/">PICSO lab</a> with <a href="http://www.yurulin.com/">Dr. Yuru Lin</a> at our school. I myself have finished a paper on using Transfer Learning to apply BERT models to downstream tasks, and it has been accepted by 2023 International Conference on Signal Processing and Machine Learning. In addition, I just finished a review project on Bayesian Optimization under the guidance of Dr. Joseph Yurko.</p><p>I am very interested in the <strong>Data Privacy</strong> in <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> area and <strong>decentralized systems</strong>, such as blockchain. I think cloud computing and privacy are of great potential and would be paid more and more attention. We can imagine in the future, all of our work could be done on our little smartphone with the help of cloud computing (actually this imagination has now been realized to a certain extent), and since we will get services from various organizations and individuals in this process, we don’t want our privacy to be exposed. Therefore, in my opinion, privacy should be one of the most critical concerns for future cloud computing and computer science, and I am very interested in these topics. I would be appreciative if there is any opportunities for possible Ph.D. positions in all of these areas.  </p><p>Also, I am interested in most of the general directions in machine learning, including <strong>Trustworthy ML</strong>, <strong>Data Mining</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and <strong>related algorithms</strong>.  I am still a “curious” student in the ocean of machine learning, so I am definitely willing to explore and learn more about this “exciting” and “magic” ocean.  </p><p>Here is <a href="/attaches/Zian_Wang_CV.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>my CV</strong></a> and <a href="/attaches/PITT_TSRPT.pdf" target="_blank"> <strong>my transcript</strong> </a></p><h2 id="Papers"><a href="#Papers" class="headerlink" title="Papers"></a>Papers</h2><p><font size = "3"> (Forgive me for calling this section “papers” rather than “publications” since the articles have not been published yet.) </font><br><font size = "1"></font><br><strong>2022:</strong><br><a href="/attaches/A_New_Computationally_Efficient_Method_to_Tune_BertNetworks_Transfer_Learning.pdf" target="_blank">A New Computationally Efficient Method to Tune BERT Networks – Transfer Learning</a><br>Zian Wang<br><em>Accepted by the 2023 International Conference on Signal Processing and Machine Learning (CONF-SPML 2023).</em></p><p><strong>2021:</strong><br><a href="/attaches/DM_Final_report.pdf" target="_blank">Police Union Contract Misconduct Complaint Detection</a><br>Zian Wang, Sonal Gupta, Shuo Zheng<br><em>A final report paper for the Data Mining course, topic is given by Dr. Lin Yuru.</em></p>]]></content>
